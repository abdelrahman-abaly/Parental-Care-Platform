# Parental-Care-Platform

## âœ¨ Parental-Care-Platform
In this project, I have created a website that helps teachers send direct messages to student's parents.  
I have used HTML and CSS for the front-end, PHP for the back-end, and for the dynamic update for the notices we have used JAVASCRIPT.

## ðŸ’¡ Features:
1. Complete form validation and authentication.
2. If the user forgets the password, added forgot-password form to reset the password.
3. Password is stored in encrypted format.
4. Notices we be refresh automatically after 2 mins without reloading the page.
5. Dynamic search bar.
6. Easy to use and best user experience.
